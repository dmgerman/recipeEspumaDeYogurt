EspumaDeYogurt
================

It is fairly simple and the ratios are easy to remember:

6-2-1

or if you have a 500ml siphon:

- 375 ml of yogurt
- 125 ml of whipping cream (35%)
- 62.5 gr of sugar
- 2 cartridges of NO2


- mix all ingredients by hand until the sugar is fully incorporated, 
- pour mix into the siphon (I always sieve what I put in the siphon to avoid clogging it) 
- charge with 1 cartridge (NO2), shake vigorously
- charge again with second cartridge.
- shake as much as you can

put in the fridge for a couple of hours (important)

ready to serve? shake it and serve.

You can vary the ratios, but the cream is important (NO2 binds to
fat). I have seen recipes with as low as 1/5 of the yogurt. 

my preferred topping is simply honey. It goes extremely well with it.

Now, my variations:

- I Add 0.2% of xanthan gum to total weight (i.e. for 0.5L i would use 1
  gr) to stabilize it once dispensed. Otherwise it tends to be runny
  very quickly.

- I always keep a jar of sugar with a vanilla bean inside. This sugar adds a
  slight vanilla flavour. You can also add few drops of vanilla extract
  I presume (untested :)
